# Sample Research Note

> This MDX file is an example placeholder. Replace with real content or remove if the blog is not needed.

## Motivation

- Provide a space for research updates and reading notes.
- Demonstrate math and code formatting.

```python
def placeholder():
    return "Hello, MARL!"
```

Inline math example: $Q(s, a)$, and block math:

$$
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} [ R_t ].
$$

<Callout title="Implementation detail">
  This callout uses the shared component for consistent styling.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

1. Replace this MDX with real posts.
2. Extend frontmatter fields as needed.
