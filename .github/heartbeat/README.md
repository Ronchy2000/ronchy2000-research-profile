# Heartbeat Directory

This directory contains automated heartbeat files that ensure daily commits to the repository.

## Purpose

- **`.last-sync`** - Timestamp file updated daily by the scheduled workflow
- Ensures the repository has regular activity even when there are no content changes
- Only generated during scheduled runs (not manual triggers)

## Why Here?

- Files in `.github/` are not processed by Next.js or static site generators
- Keeps the `content/` directory clean and focused on actual content
- Prevents heartbeat files from being included in the website build

## Do Not Edit Manually

This file is automatically generated by GitHub Actions. Manual changes will be overwritten.
